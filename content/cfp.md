## Abstract

The ever-increasing demand for online content moderation and user
profiling sees the adaptation of web intelligence concepts that were developed
in good faith, into a censorship and surveillance apparatus owned by
corporations and national agencies. Consequently, users are bound to an
Orwellian Internet where mainstream platforms -- such as search engines, social
media, and content providers -- place the blame for filter bubbles and extensive
user behavioral analysis on artificial intelligence. This is alarming, since it is particularly
difficult to distinguish between AI bias and deliberate human intervention. TICS
aims to explore the technological, socio-economic, and legal means and driving
forces behind these issues, and to propose alternative directions for building a
semantic and human-centric web that promotes empowerment of individuals to decide
on how their identities are -- or are not -- constructed and aggregated online.

## Topics

The goal of TICS is to raise awareness around the implications of network
interference, by inviting researchers from complementary disciplines to consider
the effect of their own domain on online censorship and surveillance. Along
those lines, we invite submissions that address the following topics:

* Research on technologies and policies that build upon advancements on the
    field of web intelligence to imply blocking, limitation or distortion of the
    availability of network services and online content
* The application of web intelligence concepts such as behavioral modeling,
    data mining, and social network analytics to target groups and individuals
    by law enforcement agencies and private corporations
* The implications of algorithmic and AI-assisted user content classification
    (such as for identification of hatespeech, copyright, or disinformation)
* Novel techniques that leverage web intelligence to defend netizens against
    censorship and surveillance, or privacy enhancements to the existing AI
    infrastructure to mitigate these threats
* Measurement methodologies that detect network interference or content
    moderation based on crowd knowledge or web analytics
* The socio-economic consequences and implementation limitations and fallacies
    of upload filters and recommendation systems
* Business models and amendments to legal frameworks which promote the use of
    web intelligence in ways that build a pluralistic, private, and
    human-centric experience without violating user freedoms

## Important dates

 * Paper Submission due:            **July 10th, 2019**
 * Notification to authors:         Aug 10th, 2019
 * Final, camera ready papers, due: Aug 20th, 2019
 * Workshop date:                   Oct 14th, 2019
